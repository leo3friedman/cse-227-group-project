application for copying Google search results

When you google something just click on extension label and get handy list of search results links. 

Press "Copy" to copy numbered list to your buffer. 
Also works with images and videos - showing link of pages(not "src" link).


If you need more functions - just write me on oleksii.automation @ gmail.com.
